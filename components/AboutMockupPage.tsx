          <div className="osb-about-story-inner">
            <h2 id="about-story-heading">Why we built this</h2>
            <p>
              Open Source Barware started with a problem every working bar manager recognizes:
              close out, grab the clipboard, count bottles by tenths, walk to the office, type
              numbers into a spreadsheet from 2014, try to reconcile against POS sales, and watch
              it never quite add up. The industry has lived that loop for decades while vendors
              sold inventory guns, monthly SaaS fees, and consulting priced by the bottle.
            </p>
            <p>
              We built the program we wished existed. It is free, open source, and designed around
              how bars actually run — voice notes on a walk-through, a spreadsheet everyone can
              read, weekly inputs for counts and invoices, and an AI home base that explains what
              changed instead of hiding behind a dashboard. No signup wall. No email capture. No
              investor deck between you and a clean count.
            </p>

            <h2>What &ldquo;open source&rdquo; means here</h2>
            <p>
              The program, documentation, and operating logic are meant to stay in the open. You can
              download the system, run it in Chrome, connect the AI provider you already trust, and
              keep your own inventory map and weekly packet on your terms. Fork it. Improve it. Share
              it with the next bar that is tired of renting their own workflow.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>One free Chrome-side program — not six upsells dressed as a toolkit.</li>
              <li>Customer-owned data with provider-connected AI, not a black-box platform.</li>
              <li>Checks and gates before the first live count, so the map is right before the math.</li>
              <li>Weekly rhythm: count the room, add invoices and POS, read the story.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What&rsquo;s next</h2>
            <p>
              Now we build <strong>The World Hidden Bar Tour</strong>. City by city, every couple of
              months, we visit a new market — the bars that are popular and famous, the bartenders
              working those rooms, and the locals who actually know where to go after last call. We
              spend a few days on the floor, collect their recommendations for hidden bars, and tour
              the spots they trust to build another hidden-bar map for that city.
            </p>
            <p>
              Miami is first. Richard spent ten years there and already has five bars almost nobody
              outside the trade would think to visit — places that are absolutely brilliant once you
              know they exist. September is the first venture. That is what the fundraising is for.
            </p>
            <p>
              The inventory program is only the start. Next comes a full wine inventory system —
              updated pour logic, pitchers in depth, and hundreds of varietals of wine. A chat forum
              where bartenders can network, share what works, and talk shop with each other. And a
              full resource library — cocktail references, beer and wine references, and everything
              else worth keeping behind the bar, free for the people who use it.
            </p>

              moving and funds the next layer of tools, tours, and trade knowledge we are building
              for the people behind the stick.
